## Merkle Trie Generator

### This implementation provides:

## Key Features

1. **Pure Rust Implementation**: No external cryptographic dependencies - uses a simplified hash function for demonstration (in production, we'd replace it with proper hashing/digest function, like SHA-256)

2. **Complete Merkle Tree**: Binary tree structure with internal nodes and leaf nodes

3. **Root Hash**: Computed from bottom-up tree construction

4. **Merkle Proofs**: Complete proofs with all sibling hashes needed to verify a leaf's inclusion

5. **Proof Verification**: Both instance-based and static verification methods

## Core Components

- **MerkleNode**: Represents both leaf and internal nodes
- **MerkleProof**: Contains leaf data and sibling hashes with position information
- **MerkleTrie**: Main structure managing the tree and operations

## Key Methods

- `add_leaf()`: Add data to the tree
- `build_tree()`: Construct the tree from leaves
- `get_root_hash()`: Get the tree's root hash
- `generate_proof()`: Create merkle proof for any leaf
- `verify_proof()`: Verify a proof against the tree
- `update_leaf()`: Modify existing leaf data
- `remove_leaf()`: Remove leaf and rebuild tree

## Usage Example

```rust
let mut trie = MerkleTrie::new();
trie.add_leaf(b"Hello".to_vec());
trie.add_leaf(b"World".to_vec());
trie.build_tree();

let root_hash = trie.get_root_hash().unwrap();
let proof = trie.generate_proof(b"Hello").unwrap();
assert!(trie.verify_proof(&proof));
```

The implementation handles edge cases like odd numbers of leaves (by duplication) and provides comprehensive testing. For production use, we'd replace the simplified hash function with a proper cryptographic hash/digest, like SHA-256.
